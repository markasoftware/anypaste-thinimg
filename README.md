# Anypaste Thinimg Plugin

This is an example [Anypaste](https://anypaste.xyz) plugin, to demonstrate how plugins should be made.

## Installing

This plugin can be installed like any other plugin. Just download the `thinimg` file from this repo into your `~/.anypaste-plugins` folder (you'll need to create it if it doesn't exist), mark it executable, and add `thinimg` to `ap_plugins` in your config file (usually `~/.config/anypaste.conf`).
